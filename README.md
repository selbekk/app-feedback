# Get feedback from your users!

If you're like me, you love to release your new websites to beta testers way
too early. An important aspect of this, however, is to get feedback from your
users.

This application adds a configurable feedback module to your site, that gets
you feedback _right away_!

## Planned features

- Add modal
- Add option for not having any styling (for both part and dialogue)
- Add input type for thumbs up / thumbs down
- Add input type for 5 stars rating
- Admin widget for seeing the feedback? that would be cool
